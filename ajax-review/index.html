<strong>Subject:</strong> IMPORTANT AJAX Review!
<strong>Date:</strong> Thurs April 30, 2015 1:50:59 AM PDT

Team!,

That was some great work with the customer profile form.

I was thinking, wouldn't it be awesome if we had some fun things
on the site so when our customers want to order melons, they can
also play games.

Brilliant right!?

Anyway, I got started on this and then realized the new episode of
CSI: Cyber is on.

Can you finish setting up the functionality with AJAX?

Awesome.

Thanks!!!
Mel

<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>practice basic AJAX patterns using .get()</li>
</ul>
<p>In this exercise, you'll be working with a small Flask application. It has three features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>providing a random fortune</li>
<li>provide a weather forecast for a zipcode</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this application, you'll find the documentation for jQuery super helpful!</p>
<p><strong>To start:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a virtual environment and install Flask into it</li>
<li>Run the server and take a look at the index page.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="part-1-random-fortune">
<h1>Part 1: Random Fortune</h1>
<p>We want the user to get a random fortune when the click the &quot;Get Fortune&quot; button.
This fortune should appear in the #fortune-text div. This should not be a full HTML
page, but be done using an AJAX-style call.</p>
<p>There is already a route in the Flask server for this, at <cite>/fortune</cite>.</p>
<p>Fill in the function in the Javascript file to load the text returned by this route
and put it into the #fortune-text div.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="part-2-weather-harder">
<h1>Part 2: Weather (Harder)</h1>
<p>We want the user to be able to type in a zipcode and get a forecast back for that
zipcode.</p>
<p>There is already a route in the Flask server, <cite>/weather</cite>, that returns a JSON object
like <tt class="docutils literal">{temp: TEMP, forecast: FORECAST}</tt>. We don't want to actually show the temperature
on the page, though, just the forecast (this is a common pattern: APIs tend to return
a lot of data, and we only want to show some.)</p>
<p>Fill in the missing parts of the function in the Javascript file. You'll need to
decide which kind of AJAX call to make, and how to extract the forecast from the
JSON object you get back.</p>
