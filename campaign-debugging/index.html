<strong>Subject:</strong> <em>DEFINITELY URGENT</em> OUR TWITTER IS DOWN

Hey,

You're good with the internet, right??!!! I just found out that our
social media manager is really twenty-three parakeets randomly
pecking keys on a keyboard covered with seeds. I'd like to replace
them with a real social media manager but we just don't have the funds;
buying up all of the Winter Squash so that Squysh is understocked is
taking up all of our capital. Unfortunately, the best we can do is to
automate our twitter presence. I think it's much more important for us
to be consistent with our posting than insightful, don't you think?

Fortunately, our new jr. jr. development team built a markov script that
can generate appropriately sized tweets for us. It looks pretty good,
but it's not quite working right. Or at all. It might need some debugging.
Right now, it's telling me I have an ImportError--I don't have time to
read the documentation to figure out what that means. All I know is that
I need to use the sys.argv function. The error looks a bit like this:

    $ python campaign_markov.py melons.txt
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File &quot;campaign_markov.py&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
            import argv
    ImportError: No module named argv

Do you think you could help troubleshoot this error and any other errors
you find that are keeping this script from working properly? I've also
included a file of some great melon related inspirational messages;
I'd like this file to be passed to the markov generator in order to get
this script up and working as soon as possible.

Or, at least before the CEO notices that the birds have been fired.

I'm attaching two files: <cite>campaign_markov.py</cite> is the main script and
<cite>melons.txt</cite> contains the text for use.

Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead
