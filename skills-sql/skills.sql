-- 1. Select all columns for all brands in the Brands table.

SELECT * FROM Brands;

-- 2. Select all columns for all car models made by Pontiac in the Models table.

SELECT * FROM Models WHERE brand_name = 'Pontiac';

-- 3. Select the brand name and model
--    name for all models made in 1964 from the Models table.

SELECT brand_name, name FROM Models WHERE year = 1964;

-- 4. Select the model name, brand name, and headquarters for the Ford Mustang
--    from the Models and Brands tables.

SELECT m.name, m.brand_name, headquarters
FROM Models AS m
  JOIN Brands AS b
    ON b.name = m.brand_name
  WHERE m.brand_name = 'Ford' AND m.name = 'Mustang';


-- 5. Select all rows for the three oldest brands
--    from the Brands table (Hint: you can use LIMIT and ORDER BY).

SELECT *
FROM Brands
  ORDER BY founded
  LIMIT 3;

-- 6. Count the Ford models in the database (output should be a **number**).

SELECT count(*)
FROM Models
  WHERE brand_name = 'Ford';

-- 7. Select the **name** of any and all car brands that are not discontinued.

SELECT name
FROM Brands
  WHERE discontinued IS NULL;

-- 8. Select rows 15-25 of the DB in alphabetical order by model name.

SELECT *
FROM Models
  WHERE id BETWEEN 15 AND 25
ORDER BY name;

-- 9. Select the **brand, name, and year the model's brand was
--    founded** for all of the models from 1960. Include row(s)
--    for model(s) even if its brand is not in the Brands table.
--    (The year the brand was founded should be ``null`` if
--    the brand is not in the Brands table.)

SELECT m.brand_name, m.name, founded
FROM Models AS m
  LEFT JOIN Brands AS b
    ON m.brand_name = b.name
  WHERE year = 1960;

-- Part 2: Change the following queries according to the specifications.
-- Include the answers to the follow up questions in a comment below your
-- query.

-- 1. Modify this query so it shows all **brands** that are not discontinued
-- regardless of whether they have any cars in the cars table.
-- before:

  -- SELECT b.name,
  --        b.founded,
  --        m.name
  -- FROM Model AS m
  --   LEFT JOIN brands AS b
  --     ON b.name = m.brand_name
  -- WHERE b.discontinued IS NULL;

    SELECT b.name
    FROM Brands AS b
      LEFT JOIN Models AS m
        ON b.name = m.brand_name
      WHERE b.discontinued IS NULL
      GROUP BY b.name;

      -- need to left join from Brands so all brands are shown.

-- 2. Modify this left join so it only selects models that have brands in the Brands table.
-- before:
    -- SELECT m.name,
    --        m.brand_name,
    --        b.founded
    -- FROM Models AS m
    --   LEFT JOIN Brands AS b
    --     ON b.name = m.brand_name;

    SELECT m.name, m.brand_name, b.founded
    FROM Models AS m
      JOIN Brands AS b
        ON m.brand_name = b.name;

-- followup question: In your own words, describe the difference between
-- left joins and inner joins.

-- Inner joins will select all records from Table A that have a matching record in Table B, omitting any records that have missing data. Left joins will display all records from Table A, regardless if there is a matching record in Table B.

-- 3. Modify the query so that it only selects brands that don't have any car models in the cars table.
-- (Hint: it should only show Tesla's row.)
-- before:
    -- SELECT name,
    --        founded
    -- FROM Brands
    --   LEFT JOIN Models
    --     ON brands.name = Models.brand_name
    -- WHERE Models.year > 1940;

    SELECT b.name, founded
    FROM Brands AS b
      LEFT JOIN Models AS m
        ON b.name = m.brand_name
      WHERE m.name IS NULL;

-- 4. Modify the query to add another column to the results to show
-- the number of years from the year of the model *until* the brand becomes discontinued
-- Display this column with the name years_until_brand_discontinued.
-- before:
    -- SELECT b.name,
    --        m.name,
    --        m.year,
    --        b.discontinued
    -- FROM Models AS m
    --   LEFT JOIN brands AS b
    --     ON m.brand_name = b.name
    -- WHERE b.discontinued NOT NULL;

    SELECT b.name, m.name, m.year, b.discontinued, (b.discontinued - m.year) AS years_until_brand_discontinued
    FROM Models AS m
      LEFT JOIN brands AS b
        ON m.brand_name = b.name
    WHERE b.discontinued NOT NULL;


-- Part 3: Futher Study

-- 1. Select the **name** of any brand with more than 5 models in the database.

SELECT b.name, count(*)
FROM Brands AS b
  LEFT JOIN Models AS m
    ON b.name = m.brand_name
  GROUP BY b.name HAVING count(*) > 5;

-- 2. Add the following rows to the Models table.

-- year    name       brand_name
-- ----    ----       ----------
-- 2015    Chevrolet  Malibu
-- 2015    Subaru     Outback

INSERT INTO Models (year, name, brand_name)
  VALUES (2015, 'Malibu', 'Chevrolet'), (2015, 'Outback', 'Subaru');

-- 3. Write a SQL statement to crate a table called ``Awards``
--    with columns ``name``, ``year``, and ``winner``. Choose
--    an appropriate datatype and nullability for each column.

CREATE TABLE Awards(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(20),
  year INTEGER,
  winner VARCHAR(20)
);

-- 4. Write a SQL statement that adds the following rows to the Awards table:

--   name                 year      winner_model_id
--   ----                 ----      ---------------
--   IIHS Safety Award    2015      # get the ``id`` of the 2015 Chevrolet Malibu
--   IIHS Safety Award    2015      # get the ``id`` of the 2015 Subaru Outback

INSERT INTO Awards (name, year, winner)
  VALUES ('IIHS Safety Award', 2015, (SELECT id FROM Models WHERE name = 'Malibu')),('IIHS Safety Award', 2015, (SELECT id FROM Models WHERE name = 'Outback'));

-- 5. Using a subquery, select only the *name* of any model whose
-- year is the same year that *any* brand was founded.

SELECT name, year
FROM Models
WHERE year IN (SELECT founded FROM Brands);
