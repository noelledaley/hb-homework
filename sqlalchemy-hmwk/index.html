<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We've created a file <cite>model.py</cite> that, when run, creates a database
of Hackbright employees. The focus of today's homework is to get some
practice querying a database using SQLAlchemy to get information that
you want. If you need help, take a look at the SQLAlchemy I &amp; II lectures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>Before you get started querying, make sure to do the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make and run a virtual environment in your working directory.</li>
<li>Install the requirements via the requirements.txt file.</li>
<li>Create and populate the database using <cite>python -i model.py</cite></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="directions">
<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>Now that your database is established, Here are the queries that we'd
like you to run:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First, try using the included function from model.py to get a list of all employees.</li>
<li>Grab the employee object with the name 'Cynthia Dueltgen'</li>
<li>What department is she in? (Show the object for her department.)</li>
<li>What is the phone number of the department that Cynthia is in?</li>
<li>Find all employees where we don't know which department they belong to.
(they have <cite>NULL</cite> department codes)</li>
<li>Get a list of tuples with just the name of everyone whose favorite color is orange.</li>
<li>Find all employees who work in 'Administration'</li>
</ul>
